Generate the following two result sets:

Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:
There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.

where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.
Note: There will be at least two entries in the table for each type of occupation.

Analysis
We can use CONCAT() function to solve this problem. The syntax is ‘CONCAT(str1, str2, …)’ and it returns the string that results from concatenating the arguments.
And we can use SUBSTR() or LEFT() function to get first letter of Occupation. Syntax of SUBSTR() I use here is ‘SUBSTR(str, pos, len)’ and it returns a substring len characters long from string str, starting at position pos. Syntax of LEFT() is ‘LEFT(str, len)’ and it returns the leftmost len characters from the string str, or NULL if any argument is NULL.
Additionally,

from OCCUPATIONS table ==> FROM OCCUPATIONS
alphabetically ordered list of names ==> ORDER BY Name
occupation_count ==> COUNT(Occupation) … GROUP BY Occupation
lowercase occupation name ==> LOWER(Occupation)
sort occurrences in ascending order ==> ORDER BY COUNT(Occupation)
order alphabetically if having the same occupation_count ==>
ORDER BY COUNT(Occupation), Occupation

Solutions 1

SELECT CONCAT(Name, '(', SUBSTR(Occupation,1,1),')') 
FROM OCCUPATIONS 
ORDER BY Name;

SELECT CONCAT('There are a total of ', COUNT(Occupation), ' ', LOWER(Occupation), 's.') 
FROM OCCUPATIONS 
GROUP BY Occupation 
ORDER BY COUNT(Occupation), Occupation;

Solutions 2
SELECT CONCAT(Name, '(', LEFT(Occupation,1),')') FROM OCCUPATIONS ORDER BY Name;
SELECT CONCAT('There are a total of ', COUNT(Occupation), ' ', LOWER(Occupation), 's.') 
FROM OCCUPATIONS GROUP BY Occupation ORDER BY COUNT(Occupation), Occupation;
