Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:
1.Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
2.Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
3.Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
4.Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

First Solution
-- SELECT 
-- CASE 
--     WHEN A + B > C AND A+C>B AND B+C>A THEN CASE 
--     WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral' 
--     WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles' 
--     WHEN A != B OR B != C OR A != C THEN 'Scalene' 
--     END ELSE 'Not A Triangle' 
--     END FROM TRIANGLES;

Second Solution
select case
when A+B <= C or A+C <= B or B+C <= A then "Not A Triangle"
when A=B and B=C then "Equilateral"
when A=B or A=C or B=C then "Isosceles"
else "Scalene"
end as triangles_type
from TRIANGLES;
